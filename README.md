# Final-Project-SQL

### The Situation
You and your business partner were recently approached by another local business owner who is interested in purchasing your Movies Rental Business. He primarily owns restaurant and bars, so he has lots of questions for you about your business and the rental business in general. His offer seems very generous, so you are going to entertain his questions.

### The Objective
Leverage your SQL skills to extract and analyze data from various tables in the Movies Database to answer you potential Acquirerâ€™s questions. Each question will require you to write a multi-table SQL query, joining at least two tables.
